So hello again. In last 2 days (I think?) I was redesigning entire website. I know, I know...
But I love designing websites, and I really wanted to try [Bootstrap 4 alpha](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com).
And it turns out that it is preeeety awesome.

Of course, I am experiencing some compatibility issues with Bootstrap 3 here and there (I had a lot of troubles to get the `tabs` working) but it is still awesome. Also, I noticed that Bootstrap 4 seems more "lightweight". For example, there is no default style for navbar. But maybe it is only because it is just missing. But it is also missing style for `blockquote` and I also had to set body padding manually, what do not happened in BS3.

Also, I added super sexy header with some JavaScript particle animations. I found it somewhere on internet, so I decided to use them.

And as last thing, I learned more about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and `Liquid`. It is fun how dynamic can static site be. For `Projects` page, I first time used `Jekyll` `_data` thingies, and it is super awesome (sorry for saying awesome again and again), and I just love YAML. And Ruby isn't that bad too ;)

I will try to be more active on GitHub and here from now, so hopefully there won't be months gaps between posts lol.
