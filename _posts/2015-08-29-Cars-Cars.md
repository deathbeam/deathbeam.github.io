Again me. I know I am boring and I do not care. I wanted to present you game on what is my friend working.
That game name is Cars Cars. It is Need For Speed - like game situated in Slovakia in my born city Banska Bystrica. [Check Cars Cars on Gamejolt](http://gamejolt.com/games/cars-cars/68842)

Never heard about Banska Bystrica? Good for you. But he is working hard on Cars Cars, so if you can, support him by following his game and Gamejolt,
I am sure he will appreciate it.
