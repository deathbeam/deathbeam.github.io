Hello again. I did some major progress on <a href="https://github.com/nondev/kaizo">Kaizo</a> today.
Making my own build automation engine is really fun. And with super easy to use NuGet and Microsoft libraries,
I created working based in few days.

Right now, entire dependency management and task system is working. But, I only implemented build and copy tasks,
but more will come soon. For beginning I have planned these:

<ul>
<li>file</li>
<li>delete</li>
<li>zip</li>
<li>rename</li>
</ul>

Also, I am trying to figure a way how to add support for subprojects. But I think it will not be that hard.
Here is screenie of current console output:
